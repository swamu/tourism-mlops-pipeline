## 📋 Project Overview

An end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting customer purchase behavior for the Wellness Tourism Package. This project implements automated data processing, model training with experiment tracking, and deployment using CI/CD best practices.

## 🎯 Business Problem

"Visit with Us," a leading travel company, needs to efficiently identify customers likely to purchase the Wellness Tourism Package. This ML solution automates customer targeting, improving marketing efficiency and conversion rates.

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Data Registration → Data Preparation → Model Training → Model Deployment
        ↓                  ↓                 ↓                ↓
   Hugging Face      Train/Test Split    MLflow Tracking   Streamlit App
   Dataset Hub       Feature Engineering  Model Selection   Docker Container
```

## 🚀 Features

- **Automated Data Pipeline**: Registers and preprocesses datasets on Hugging Face Hub

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Hugging Face account and token
- GitHub account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/tourism-mlops-pipeline.git
cd tourism-mlops-pipeline
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r tourism_project/requirements.txt
```

3. Set environment variables:
```bash
export HF_TOKEN=your_huggingface_token
```

### Running Locally

1. **Data Preparation**:
```bash
python tourism_project/data_preparation.py
```

2. **Model Training**:
```bash
python tourism_project/model_building/train.py
```

3. **Run Streamlit App**:
```bash
cd tourism_project/deployment
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically:
1. Registers dataset on Hugging Face
2. Prepares and splits data
3. Trains models with MLflow tracking
4. Deploys the best model to Hugging Face Spaces

### Setup GitHub Actions

1. Add `HF_TOKEN` to repository secrets
2. Push code to trigger pipeline
3. Monitor workflow in Actions tab
